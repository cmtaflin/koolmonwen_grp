This file contains a list of javascript files and how they can be used by the group. Hopefully this makes it easier on all of us to pick and choose the code examples we need.
Note that our 11/17 class is probably the best in-class reference for creating charts in plotly from flask.  Not copying any of these files now, but an FYI.

app_bellybutton.js
This file is from the plotly homework.  This is the #1 reference file. Contains items that can be helpful as follows:
- integrates with Flask routes (multiple)
- populates data list from pull-down
- charts all change values/output based on pull-down decision. (our dashboard page)

D3_SVG_app.js
This file is from the D3 / SVG homework. This is a great reference for a possible scatterplot and customized output.
- reads csv file
- multiple circles and labels them.
- basic tooltip functionality

interactive_chart_app.js
This is from the last exercise in our 11/28 class - the hair band scatterplot. It is also a reference for the advanced answer to our D3 homework (which I didn't do). this is the ideal chart for the bottom of the dashboard page.
- reads csv file
- functions create scatterplots based on what x/y axis label is clicked
- tooltips
- event listeners

responsive_app.js
This is an in-class file from 11/28 that had the chart change size when the window changed size.
- responsive chart

table_app.js
This file contains the query to generate a bootstrap table in a web page based on the user's query. Mine is pretty basic.
- event listener
